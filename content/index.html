    <h3>Social Events</h3>
    <p>
      Geekos are a hard-working, fun-loving bunch.  But even Geekos need a break to socialize and get some food in their bellies.  That's why we bring you the Geeko Lounge.  A place to relax, put your feet up and hang out with fellow Geekos. Each morning we serve breakfast, and throughout the day, we'll have refreshments to quench your thirst and nibble on. Couches and bean bags to plop your dupa on as you take a breather from the hustle and bustle of the busy day checking out sessions. We are also planning to add a party or two, so check back to get the latest info.

We share the OSEM instance with the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference</a>, thus please pay attention that you register for the event you intend to participate in.
